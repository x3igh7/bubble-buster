Gonna bust a bubble

Basic idea - try to find difference in reporting and responses regarding similar topics. 

We will do this initally by polling the latest twitter feeds of 3 news sources: FOX News, CNN and MSNBC.

We then will do string comparision between amongst those tweets to see if we can find common topics that all three news organizations are tweetings about. 

Ideally, these tweets will have links to articles, which we can do sentitment analysis on.

We'll tweet our findings.

Eventually we'd want to analyze the responses to these tweets on topics that we're examining. We could do this by looking at replies to the tweets, and maybe comments on the articles' pages. 

We expect to find that:
* different news organizations talk about events different, and that their followers tend to reflect the same sentiments 
* people don't follow multi news organizations and are unlikely to understand there's competeting sentiments
* some news organizations won't talk about the same thing at all, so sentiment is not always a self-siloing phenomenon
